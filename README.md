# Gallery Web App

A simple gallery app to store, group and categorize images.

Build using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Firebase](https://firbease.google.com/)

Utilizes my [`firebase-storage-cache-server`](https://github.com/MatthiasHarzer/firebase-storage-cache-server) to cache and scale user uploaded images.
